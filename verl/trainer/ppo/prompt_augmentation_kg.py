Prompt augmentation utilities for Knowledge Graph-based question answering.

This module provides instruction guidelines and augmentation functionality
to help models learn proper KG query formatting and reasoning patterns.

Available guideline levels:
- "extensive": Full detailed instructions with comprehensive explanations
- "detailed": Default guidelines with 5 query limit + KG prioritization
- "detailed_hierarchical": Hierarchical format examples with query functions
- "detailed_flat": Flat format examples with query functions
- "detailed_flat_turn7": Multi-turn reasoning with up to 7 turns and 7 kg-queries
- "detailed_flat_10arxiv": 10ArXiv-specific research paper domain reasoning with academic terminology
- "minimal" or "detailed_minimal": Minimal prompt with basic KG functions only (for clean evaluation without extensive guidance)
- "vanilla": Simple direct answering without KG or reasoning instructions
- "cot": Chain-of-Thought prompting with reasoning steps before answers

You are allowed to make up to 7 kg-queries. 
If you encounter a KG-related error, read the error message carefully and correct your query.

Use exactly these query functions:
- get_relations_out(entity): Returns outgoing relations where the entity is the subject/head (entity → relation → ?).
- get_relations_in(entity): Returns incoming relations where the entity is the object/tail (? → relation → entity).
- get_entities_out(entity, relation): Returns entities connected from the given entity by the specified relation (entity → relation → ?).
- get_entities_in(entity, relation): Returns entities from which the given entity is connected by the specified relation (? → relation → entity).

IMPORTANT:
- Always begin with think after getting question or information.
- Always prefer information retrieved from the KG over your internal knowledge.
- Use KG data as your primary source if relevant information is available.

Examples of entities:
- Named entities: "Barack Obama", "Taylor Swift", "Albert Einstein", "New York City", "France", "Mount Everest", "Google", "United Nations", "Harvard University"
- Entity IDs: "m.02mjmr", "m.09c7w0"
